# log_parser

Parse unicycler.log files, generated by Unicycler after an assembly, to extract
information (tables) about the assembled chromosomes and plasmids.

## Function
   
To run this program, you need a folder containing subfolders with Unicycler
results. For example, you can have a hypothetical folder named results that
could be the input folder and could contain the SW0001 and SW0002 Unicycler
result subfolders as follows:

```
    ~/Documents/results/
                    SW0001/
                        unicycler.log
                    SW0002/
                        unicycler.log
```

The program will first search for unicycler.log in the SW0001 subfolder,
parse the file and create three tables as csv files with relevant information
about the assembly. The first column of each row will contain the name of
the subfolder, in this case SW0001. The program will continue with the next
subfolders, SW0002, and append the extracted information to the csv files.
The generated csv files will be named status_summary, depth_summare, and
assemblies_summary. The subfolders (SWXXXX) can have other files or
folders, the program will only analyze unicycler.log files.

## Example of usage

Using the directory tree shown above, you can run the program as follows:

```bash
python3 log_parser.py -i ~/Documents/results -o ~/Documents/results
```
